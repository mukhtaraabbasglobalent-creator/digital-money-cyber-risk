Central banks operate the most sensitive digital financial systems in any country. These systems manage national currency supply, interbank settlements, and digital currency infrastructure such as CBDCs.

High-value components include:
- RTGS settlement systems  
- National reserves ledger  
- SWIFT interbank gateways  
- CBDC wallet infrastructure  

These systems are targeted by advanced threat actors including nation-states because compromising them can allow massive unauthorized transfers or economic destabilization.

Common vulnerabilities:
- Legacy banking protocols  
- Weak segmentation  
- Credential compromise  
- Third-party access risks
